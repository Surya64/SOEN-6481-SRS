The enclosed app implements the following user story:

"As an anglophone user, I want to have the ability to read all the available options in English, so that I can understand them."

By virtue of responding to this particular user need, the francophone options are also implemented as they are complimentary functionality.

To run this application please feel free to leverage the complied and created runnable jar named "Ghalia_D2_listopts"
Alternatively, this can be launched as a Java Application from the main "LaunchTicketVendingMachine" file.
